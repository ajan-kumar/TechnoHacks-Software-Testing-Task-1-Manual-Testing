Project Title: TechnoHacks Software Testing Task 1: Manual Testing



# Manual Testing of a Scientific Calculator Web Application

## Task Overview
This project involves performing manual testing on a scientific calculator web application to identify bugs and verify functionality. The focus is on critical functionalities such as basic arithmetic operations, scientific functions, and user interface interactions.

## Problem Statement
The goal is to ensure that the scientific calculator operates as intended by executing a series of test cases and documenting any issues encountered during testing.

## Sample Web Application
- **Application Used**: Scientific Calculator
- **Link to Application**: [Link to the application if available]

## Tools Used
- Web Browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox)
- Any additional tools used for testing (e.g., bug tracking tools)

## Testing Process

### Test Cases
1. **Basic Arithmetic Operations**
   - **Description**: Verify that the calculator performs addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division correctly.
   - **Steps**: 
     1. Enter the first number.
     2. Select the operation (e.g., +, -, *, /).
     3. Enter the second number.
     4. Click the "=" button.
   - **Expected Result**: The calculator should display the correct result.

2. **Scientific Functions**
   - **Description**: Verify that scientific functions (e.g., sin, cos, tan, square root) work correctly.
   - **Steps**:
     1. Enter a number.
     2. Select a scientific function.
     3. Click the "=" button.
   - **Expected Result**: The calculator should display the correct result for the scientific function.

3. **Input Validation**
   - **Description**: Verify that the calculator handles invalid inputs gracefully.
   - **Steps**:
     1. Enter invalid characters (e.g., letters).
     2. Click the "=" button.
   - **Expected Result**: The calculator should display an error message or handle the input appropriately.

### Execution of Test Cases
- Document the results of each test case, including any bugs found during testing.
