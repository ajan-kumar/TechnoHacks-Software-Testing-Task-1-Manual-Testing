# TechnoHacks Software Testing Task 1-Manual Testing

## Task Overview
This project involves performing manual testing on an application to identify bugs and verify its functionality. The goal is to ensure that the application operates as intended and to provide suggestions for improvements based on the testing experience.

## Problem Statement
The objective is to conduct thorough manual testing on a selected application, documenting any bugs and verifying critical functionalities.

## Application:
Python

## Steps I Took:
Chose an existing application (I used the “Scientific Calculator”).
Wrote 10 test scenarios, including addition, subtraction, and other functions. 
Executed the test cases and documented the results, including 2 bugs found.

## Bug Findings:
The bugs were identified while testing the 'Factorial' and 'Division By Zero' functionalities. Since these bugs are critical features of the calculator, they have been tagged with the highest severity/priority.
